## Session Overview

**Tool:** Embedder CLI  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Focus:** I2C debugging, serial verification, documentation

---

2. Document everything that happened
3. Save all outputs including "what I see in here too"
4. Push to GitHub

## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Serial Communication Debug

**Problem:** Serial monitor not receiving any data

**Steps taken:**
1. Tried `cat /dev/cu.usbmodem2101` - timed out
2. Tried DTR/RTS reset cycling - no effect
3. Flashed minimal "Hello World" test firmware
4. Serial confirmed working - received "Hello, World! 1, 2, 3..."

### Phase 2: I2C Bus Scan

**Restored full I2C scanner and ran scan**

**Results:**
| Address | Device |
|---------|--------|
| 0x3C | SSD1306 OLED |
| 0x51 | Unknown |

**Not found:** IMU (0x6A/0x6B), VEML7700 (0x10), BME280 (0x76/0x77)

### Phase 3: Documentation

**User feedback:** "I heard small clicks but nothing worked on board"

**Explanation:** Clicks are normal - board reset via RTS pin during flash

**Files created:**
- `docs/DEBUG_SESSION_2025-01-28.md` - Clean summary
- `docs/DEBUG_SESSION_2025-01-28_RAW.md` - Complete raw output
- `src/tests/serial_test.cpp` - Saved Hello World test
- Updated `WORKLOG.md`

### Phase 4: GitHub Push

Committed and pushed all changes to `main` branch.

## Key Discoveries

1. **Board is base XIAO ESP32-S3** (not Sense variant) - no onboard IMU
2. **OLED display connected** at 0x3C
3. **Unknown device at 0x51** - needs identification
4. **Serial works** at 115200 baud via USB-CDC

---

## User Observations During Session

- Heard clicking sounds during flash operations
- No visible activity on board from user's perspective
- Multiple flash attempts occurred
